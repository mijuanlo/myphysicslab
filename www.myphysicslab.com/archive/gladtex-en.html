<p>This version of gladTeX is based on <a href="http://ans.hsh.no/home/mgg/gladtex/">gladtex 0.3</a> by Martin G. Gulbrandsen copyright (C) 1999-2002.  Please see the <code>readme</code> file in gladtex 0.3 which spells out the GNU General Public License terms.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of an equation produced by gladTeX. To see how this equation is created in gladTeX,
see <a href="web-math-en.html#my_gladtex">Displaying Math on the Web</a>.
</p>
<p class="html-math display-equation">
<eq>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}</eq>
</p>

<h2>Differences To GladTeX 0.3</h2>

<p>This version of gladTeX is different from gladTeX 0.3 in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Now works under Windows XP.</b><br>
However, this version probably ONLY works under Windows until I or someone attempts to make this version work both under Unix and Windows (not a difficult job, but I don't have a Unix system to test it with).
</li>

<li><b>Avoids re-creating equation images that already exist. </b><br>
This vastly speeds up the running time of gladTeX, especially if you are making changes to the source page which don't affect existing equations.  Briefly, here's how it works:  the LaTeX equation is written to a <code>.tex</code> file in the same directory where the <code>.png</code> file is created.  When gladTeX is asked to render a certain LaTeX expression, it first scans all the available <code>.tex</code> files to see if that expression has already been rendered.  If so, it just uses the existing <code>.png</code> file with the same name.
</li>

<li><b>Improved how inline equation images are aligned with text.</b><br>
GladTeX originally used the vertical centering of images to effect alignment with the text -- gladTex would resize the image to add blank space above or below so it would align.  This version instead uses a CSS <code>vertical-align</code> style attribute in the <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag like this:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;IMG style="vertical-align: -13px; margin: 0;" width="20" height="30"&gt;</code><br>
With this attribute, we no longer need to make the image larger with blank space.  This keeps the spacing between lines of text more compact.
</li>

<li><b>Names equation images to correspond to the HTML document they are from.</b><br>
This helps me to keep track of what equation goes with what HTML document.  Note that currently the 'avoid re-creating an image' code might find existing files that 'belong' to a different page.  (It would be fairly simple to add an option to prevent that behavior).
</li>

<li><b>Adds <code>alt</code> property to <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</b><br>
The <code>alt</code> property specifies a text equivalent for an image, which is important for visually impaired users, or for display on alternate devices or text-only browsers.  The <code>alt</code> property is required under HTML 4.01.  This version of GladTeX automatically adds the LaTeX form of the equation as the <code>alt</code> property.  You can see the <code>alt</code> text by hovering your mouse over the equation image in many browsers.
</li>

<li><b>Only supports PNG, not GIF (at present).</b><br>
I decided that PNG was good enough, and didn't try to get the GIF code to work.
</li>

<li><b>Double-quotes not allowed in LaTeX expressions.</b><br>
This is because of how I am using <code>grep</code> to search for existing files.  Since Windows command-line arguments are wrapped in double-quotes, we pass the LaTeX expression wrapped in double-quotes.  So, a double-quote in the LaTeX expression would break that part of the process.  This is not a big problem since double-quotes are pretty much not used in LaTeX anyway!  (LaTeX requires use of two single quotes like '' or back quotes `` instead).  If you really need a double quote you can use <code>\\symbol{34}</code> instead.  (Note that this limitation could be eliminated by writing the search argument to a file instead of passing it via the command-line).
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Obtaining and Installing GladTeX</h2>

<p style="margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border: dashed red 1px">
As of 2017, GladTeX development has resumed at
<a href="https://github.com/humenda/gladtex">https://github.com/humenda/gladtex</a>.
please see that page for the current version. There is a Windows version at
<a href="https://github.com/humenda/GladTeX/releases">https://github.com/humenda/GladTeX/releases</a>.

<br><br>For archival purposes, you can access the <a href="gladtex.zip">outdated version of GladTeX</a>. The rest of this page describes that outdated version.
</p>


<p>Get the two files (that are part of this software release): </p>

<pre>
    eqn2img.exe  (compiled for Windows OS)
    gladtex.pl
</pre>
<p>and put them somewhere that can be found by the Windows command line.
In addition you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>perl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I use <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActiveState perl</a></li>

<li>LaTeX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    for the commands <code>latex</code> and <code>dvips</code>  (I use <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MikTeX</a>).</li>

<li><a href="http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/grep.html">grep for Windows</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Windows version of <code>grep</code></li>

<li>ghostscript for the command <code>gswin32c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this version of gladTeX, <code>libpng</code> is part of <code>eqn2img.exe</code>, so you don't need to install <code>libpng</code> on your own.
</p>

<p>Before trying to use gladTeX, you should be able to run latex on a simple <code>.tex</code> file, and turn it into a <code>.dvi</code> file (try viewing it with a <code>.dvi</code> viewer like Yap which is part of MikTeX).  You should also be able to give the commands listed above (<code>perl, latex, dvips, grep, gswin32c</code>) at the command line.</p>




<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Put </p>
<pre>
    &lt;eq&gt;...latex code here....&lt;/eq&gt;
</pre>
<p>in your <code>.html</code> file.  But rename it to have the <code>.htex</code> extension.  Then invoke gladtex by:</p>
<pre>
    perl gladtex.pl [options] myfile.htex
</pre>

<p>where <code>[options]</code> are described in <code>gladtex.pl</code>.</p>


<p>For inline equations use</p>
<pre>
    &lt;eq inline=1&gt;...latex code here...&lt;/eq&gt;
</pre>

<p>This will result in special processing so that the equation image lines up with the other text on the line.</p>


<p>I have some additional <a href="web-math-en.html#my_gladtex">examples of GladTeX usage</a> available.  Please see the <a href="https://github.com/humenda/gladtex">official gladTeX site</a> for additional usage information.
</p>




<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>The perl file <code>gladtex.pl</code> is a perl text file.  The source code for <code>eqn2img.c</code> is provided <a href="gladtex.zip">here</a> in case you want to try to build it yourself.  There are some additional <code>.h</code> and <code>.c</code> files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getopt.c</code> is code for a command line parser.</li>

<li><code>direct.h</code> header is for directory operations like <code>_chdir</code> (<code>direct.h</code> comes with Visual C++ and is not included here)</li>

<li><code>png.h</code> is the header for <code>libpng</code> (comes with <code>libpng</code> and is not included here).
</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to obtain <code>libpng</code> and <code>zlib</code> if you want to compile <code>eqn2img.c</code>.  This is rather involved when using VisualC++ on Windows, see the accompanying file <code>'libpng notes.txt'</code> for more information.</p>



<h2>Changes to eqn2img</h2>

<p>I've made various changes to <code>eqn2img.c</code> so that it compiles and works on Windows.  In addition some other changes I made were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added the <code>-i</code> option to specify when an equation is inline with the text.  Those equations are handled specially.  They result in the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag having a <code>style="vertical-align"</code> property so that they line up with the other text on that line.  (In the old version of <code>eqn2img</code> this was done by increasing the size of the image, so that <code>align=middle</code> property would line it up, but that resulted in large spaces between lines of text).
</li>

<li>Added the <code>-e</code> option to specify the equation on the command line.
</li>

<li>No longer deletes the <code>.tex</code> file that is created.  It is used by gladtex to see if a <code>.png</code> image can be reused.
</li>

<li>Automatically adds the LaTeX version of the equation as the <code>alt</code> text for the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
